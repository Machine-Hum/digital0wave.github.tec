This works done at labs of the course, Real-Time Embedded System(ELEX-8030), at BCIT. Writing all of the software for a complete embedded control system including C++ base RTOS. The system in question mirrors a real-world application: temperature stabilization and bias control for a semiconductor laser.

The lab hardware includes: 
• A power resistor (to simulate the laser’s waste heat) 
• A thermoelectric cooler module • A temperature sensor 
• A microprocessor controller(68HC12).
