Questions

1.Connect the scope to pt3, what happens on pt3?
my prediction is:
PWM Frequency =  E_CLOCK/PRESCALE/ PWM period(ticks)
= 8M/1/4000 = 2 khz

Measured f = 2 Khz

2. What are some of limis of debuggers in real-time systems?
As stepping into the codes, the debugger maks globally, so it affects huge latency.
Also, the moment when continueing to step into , the debugger can't guarantee that the data is synchronous.

3. How much time is spent in the handler()?
use portdlc 2 and disable channels 
34 usec

4. measure the interrupt latency of handler()? and how much overhead do Isr, Ictlr, and HC12ctlr?
latency between handler() and hc12ictlr() = 11.0 usec

Overheads:
Use portdlc 3, but noise came out from scope. measured the overheads roughly.
Isr : 2 usec
Ictlr : 4 usec
HC12ctlr = 11-(2+4) usec = 7 usec

5. what is the cpu loading of PwmDriver?
measured the time the handlder starts and ends
34 usec

6. How would you modify the interrupt software to add support for wired devices connected to the IRQ
Create a task handle the external IRQ event. If the external IRQ are many, then make vector table specifiies the address of each channels

7. What classes would you support for an external IRQ for Intel process?
create tasks associated with interrupt prioritized vectors and sort the interrupts based on the prioirty in the each vector.
create interrupt control task that manages each above task to sort tasks based on the highest priority.

8. Determine the thermal time constant
Duty cycle of resistor = 0.5
V_out of LM35DT at t=0 is 0.225 V
60 % of the final V_out = 0.2137V at t = 180 sec

9. Determine the power input to the resistor at 100% duty cycle

V = 0.148V at duty =1, R =10 ohm
P = V^2/R = 0.148^2/10 = 0.00218 W = 2.19 mW

10 . Determine TEC duty cycle 
Duty cycle of TEC = 0.4 around the room temperature at 0.215V, so TEC has sufficient capcity to control the temperature of the resistor 

11. Update CPU loading 
81.0 usec
